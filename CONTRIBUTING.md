# Contributing to the Far-Edge Node Watcher

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This file explains the minimal rules we follow so PRs can be reviewed and merged quickly.

## Quick start
1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b [feature|fix|ci]/my-change`
2. Write code against `development`. Prefer small, focused PRs.

## Local Development & Tests
- Language and tools: 
    - Python (>=3.12)
    - `make`
    - bash
    - Docker (only if building images locally)
    - Kubernetes cluster (for testing)
- Build: `make build` / `make build-image`

## PR Workflow
- Open a PR against `development`.
- Use a descriptive title and reference the issue: `Fix: <short desc> (#123)`
- PR body checklist:
    - Code compiles locally
    - Added/updated tests where applicable
- At least two approving review from a maintainer required. Maintainers may request changes — please address them with new commits on the same branch.

### CI checks (required)
If a CI job fails, fix the issue or add a clear PR comment explaining why a job can be skipped.

### Labels

This repository uses labels to help with some management tasks.
| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `no-tag` | Keeps workflows from tagging the merge commit in the `main` branch and creating a release draft on pull requests merges targeting main. |
| `needs-triage` | Default label, indicating a maintainer is to correctly tag the issue |

## Version Management
FITA component versioning follows a [semantic versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) inspired scheme.

Version bumps are automated through Pull Request discussions using the `Tag on PR merged to main` workflow and [RelSync](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/RelSync).
When a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch is merged and the `no-tag` label is not present,
RelSync will be invoked to update the Helm Chart used for distribution (in the `/deploy` directory) and to create and push a new tag pointing to the latest commit in the `main` branch (the commit made by the workflow to update the Helm Chart version and values).

The workflow parses the application and Chart version bump types using the **latest PR discussion comment** with the following syntax:
```
!relsync bump (major|minor|patch|skip-app) --chart-bump-type (major|minor|patch)
```
Example:
```
!relsync bump patch --chart-bump-type minor 
```
This will cause the application to be bumped to the next patch (0.0.1 -> 0.0.2) and the chart to the next minor version (0.0.1 -> 0.1.0). 

If not specified, versions are incremented with a `patch` bump.
As Charts and application may need to be updated independently, versions may diverge.
If a new Chart is published for the same version, the application version will be kept and the published Chart will have the new version.
The repository will be tagged as `0.0.1+chart0.0.2`.

## Releases
Far-Edge Node Watcher releases are handled by the `Release` workflow. 
This workflow is triggered either by a tag being pushed to the repository,
by the `Tag on PR merged to main` workflow,
or manually via a workflow dispatch using an existing tag as its argument.

The workflow will first validate the provided tag is a valid SemVer string.
Then, it uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to build and publish container images 
for the supported platforms (amd64, arm64 and armv7) to Github Container Registry (ghcr) 
and to create a draft release in GitHub with the built artifacts.
Finally, it publishes the corresponding Helm Chart to the GitHub Container Registry as an OCI artifact.

Additionally, if the workflow was triggered by the `Tag on PR merged to main`,
after the `Release` workflow completes, the `Tag on PR merged to main` workflow merges back Helm Chart updates to the `development` branch.


## Issue reports and Feature Requests
When opening an issue make sure you are targeting the correct FITA sub-repo. You can check them anytime in the [architecture docs](https://fraunhoferportugal.github.io/fita/docs/) and in the main repo in the [`components/` directory](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/fita/tree/development/components).

In your issue report, please include the following:
- Reproduction steps
- Version/commit hash
- Relevant logs and config snippets

If you're submitting a feature request, please include a motivation or use case for your request and, optionally, a solution proposal.
